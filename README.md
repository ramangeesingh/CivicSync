# CivicSync
CivicSync makes it easy for anyone to speak up about problems in their neighbourhood...like potholes, garbage, or broken streetlights. Just report once, and we’ll make sure it reaches the right authorities. You can track what’s happening, share feedback, and even see what others around you are reporting. It’s your city, your voice matters.
